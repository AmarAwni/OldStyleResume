        <p><strong><em>Full Stack Developer And Development Instructor</em></strong></p>

        <p>My name is Ammar,
          I work as a software developer and I have a passion for teaching programming and delivering information in the simplest and best way possible.
          I studied computer engineering at 19 May University in Samsun, Turkey.
          I helped hundreds of students to learn how to code and change their lives by becoming mobile app developers.
          My first experience in programming in action was in 2008 when I wanted to create my own application and make profits by selling it in the labor market.
          Since then, I've made hundreds of apps.
          But most importantly, I realized what I love most is teaching programming.
          I spend most of my time researching how to make learning coding easy to understand.
          And I apply everything I discover in my training courses
          In my courses, you will find lots of explanations and examples to make sure everything is easy to understand.
          I will be with you every step of the way... So to make you a professional application developer
